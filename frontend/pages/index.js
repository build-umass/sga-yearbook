If you would like to order a yearbook with domestic shipping instead, we will begin offering shipping as an option in December-January.  Please follow our socials at @umassindex on Instagram for updates and pertinent information!</p>
                        <p>The Index is UMass Amherstâ€™s student-published yearbook, and the oldest yearbook in New England, having originally been published in 1870.  It chronicles anything and everything about UMass undergraduate student life, including memories, current events, clubs, agencies, athletics, student works of art, and lots of pictures.  For seniors, the yearbook also includes the graduating class, ordered by academic college, and signature pages.  In the 2021-2022 academic year, the Index is resuming publication after a 16-year hiatus!
