# The Index

### UMass Amherst's yearbook with 136 years of history

Once the oldest yearbook in New England, the Index has been published by UMass Amherst students since 1870.

## History

The Index was first published in 1870, by the third graduating class of what was then the Massachusetts Agricultural College. For the next 136 years straight, the Index chronicled the undergraduate life at UMass.

Memories, current events, clubs, agencies, athletics, student works of art, and lots of pictures were showcased in the collection. Unfortunately, the Index ceased publication after the 2005-2006 academic year.

## Our motivation

When the Index stopped publishing in 2006, it probably sounded great to replace a yearbook with something like a website or a Facebook group. Since then, however, it has become clear that the Internet can be pretty temporary: social media comes and goes, websites stop being maintained and posts get buried under a mountain of newer posts.

Yearbooks offer a unique medium of reminiscence that remains relevant. The last couple years have been a whirlwind -- from the pandemic itself to incredible movements for justice, sweeping the country and uncertainty in all aspects of nearly everyone’s lives. During historic times like these, yearbooks offer the best account of what it’s like to be in our shoes as UMass students.
